        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These Kent Island Crab Cakes with Tarragon Shallot Butter are not your 
            typical crab cake—they’re much better. They're packed with sweet jumbo 
            lump Maryland crab meat and topped with a rich tarragon butter that melts 
            down into every little bite. The best part, however, is that they contain 
            absolutely no mayo or mustard! 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>For the Crabcakes</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> 16 ounces lump crab meat</li>
            <li>2 eggs whisked</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>1 lemon juiced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>For the Butter</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh tarragon, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <h4>For the Crabcakes</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425° F.</li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, carefully combine all ingredients (it’s best 
                to use your hands). You only want to mix the ingredients until the 
                crab meat is well incorporated. Don’t over-mix or the crab meat will 
                fall apart!
            </li>

            <li>Using your hands, form 6 equally-sized crab cakes.</li>

            <li>
                Line a baking sheet with foil and spray it with cooking oil. 
                Transfer the crab cakes to the sheet.
            </li>
            
            <li>Sprinkle the crab cakes with additional Old Bay Seasoning.</li>
            <li>
                Bake the crab cakes for 15 minutes. Then, turn the oven to broil and 
                continue to cook until the crab cakes are lightly golden brown on top.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>For the Butter</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a food processor, combine all ingredients and mix until the 
                tarragon, shallots, and lemon juice are all evenly incorporated 
                throughout the butter.
            </li>
            <li>Store in the refrigerator to chill prior to serving with crab cakes.</li>
        </ol>
