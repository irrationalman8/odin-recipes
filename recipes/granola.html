        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This granola recipe is also a far more healthy granola option, since 
            it’s made with whole grains, unrefined oil and naturally sweetened. 
            You just can’t beat freshly baked granola packed with delicious and 
            good-for-you ingredients.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats </li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup raw nuts and/or seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup melted coconut oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup maple syrup or honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2/3 cup dried fruits</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, 
                rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, nuts and/or seeds, salt and 
                cinnamon. Stir to blend.

            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the oil, maple syrup and/or honey and vanilla. Mix well, 
                until every oat and nut is lightly coated. Pour the granola onto 
                your prepared pan and use a large spoon to spread it in an even layer.

            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until lightly golden, about 21 to 24 minutes, stirring halfway 
                (for extra-clumpy granola, press the stirred granola down with your 
                spatula to create a more even layer). The granola will further crisp 
                up as it cools.

            </li>
            <li>
                Let the granola cool completely, undisturbed (at least 45 minutes). 
                Top with the dried fruit (and optional chocolate chips, if using). 
                Break the granola into pieces with your hands if you want to retain
                big chunks, or stir it around with a spoon if you don’t want 
                extra-clumpy granola.

            </li>
            <li>
                Store the granola in an airtight container at room temperature for 
                1 to 2 weeks, or in a sealed freezer bag in the freezer for up to 
                3 months. The dried fruit can freeze solid, so let it warm to room 
                temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
