        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love pancakes. I have tried many different recipes but I always come back 
            to the one my mother made for me as a child. She altered the fruit with the 
            season: blueberries in the summer, apples in the fall and winter. You can 
            skip the fruit altogether and the pancakes will still be perfect. I use a 
            cast iron pan, which requires extra butter for cooking the pancakes, rather 
            than non-stick cookware. Don't forget the bacon.</p>
        <p>A pancake shouldn’t always depend on syrup, and here’s a terrific example of 
            one that does not. You begin by browning a couple of tart apples first in 
            butter, second in maple syrup. Then you fold these right into the batter, 
            creating a delicious one-stop-shopping pancake. All you need is a slick of 
            good salted butter. Sweet enough uses a handy technique for the batter, 
            beating it in a mixer until it’s as frothy as an ice cream soda – whether 
            it’s imaginary or real, the bubbles seem to lift the cakes to ethereal 
            heights.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups AP Flour</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablepsoons melted butter</li>
                <li>2-3 granny smith apples peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 tablepoon maple syrup</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>melt the two tablespoons of butter in a pan. when the butter just 
                    starts to bubble, add the apples. cook over a medium heat until 
                    they start to release their liquid. add the maple syrup and cook
                     until the apples start to caramelize. remove from heat and set 
                     aside.
                </li>
                <li>sift the dry ingredients together and set aside. put the eggs, 
                    vanilla extract and milk in a mixing bowl and beat at a high speed 
                    with an electric mixer or whisk for a few minutes until the liquid 
                    looks frothy. add the flour and mix on the lowest speed until the 
                    large lumps disappear. gently blend in the melted butter and apples. 
                    do not over mix.
                </li>
                <li>melt a tablespoon of butter in a heavy skillet over a medium high 
                    heat. the pan needs to be hot. test it by putting a drop of batter 
                    in the pan. if it sizzles, it's hot enough. using a soup ladle, 
                    add as many pancakes to the pan as it will hold without crowding.
                     when you start to see bubbles forming and the edges starting to 
                     harden, flip the pancakes over and cook for a few minutes on the
                      other side. serve with warm maple syrup.
